# FairTrades <br>
<br>
A plugin with an awesome trading system. No economy system required.<br>
The plugin name has not been decided yet, so an issue has been created titled "Plugin name"<br>
Please reply to that issue with your opinion on the plugin name<br>
<br>
# Planned Features (An example scene) <br>
<br>
Lets say $player1 = TheDragonRing  and   $player2 = remote_vase<br>
$player1 is having a trading war, and $player2 is giving the most valuable items. <br>
$player1 types "/trade $player2"<br>
Once $player1 types that, chat is suspended for those players for a duration of 10 seconds as both players can privately message each other for reason why want trade.<br>
After those 10 seconds, chat resumes for both players, and $player2 can type "/trade accept" or "/trade decline".<br>
If trade is declined $player1 will recieve a message that $player2 declined trade.<br>
If trade is accepted, chat will pause for those 2 players as they trade.<br>
Then $player1 can type "/trade additem <item in $player1 inventory>"<br>
The plugin will check $player1's inventory for if that item is there, and if it is, $player2 will recieve<br>
"$player1 added an item to trade: <item>"<br>
That additem and removeitem cycle will go on until both players type /trade final accept<br>
At any point throughout the trading cycle, a player can type "/trade cancel" to cancel trade.<br>
Obviously, if an item is removed or trade is canceled, the items will return back to the inventory required. <br>
While chat is suspended, the two players can chat with each other, but with no one else. <br>
<br>
# More detailed description of suspended chat<br>
<br>
$player1 can recieve messages from $player2, and $player2 can recieve messages from $player1. <br>
Neither of them can recieve messages from anyone or anything else, including console, and admins, so as not to disrupt their trading.<br>
<br>
Hope you like these plans!<br>
